# Case Analysis of Pacific Drilling
## Summary of the Case: Pacific Drilling: The Preferred Offshore Driller
Pacific Drilling company was founded in the year 2006, as a subsidiary of the Pacific Tanker. Chris Beckett, a 2002 MBA graduate from RICE University was appointed as the CEO of the startup. The company went through various development phases. In 2007, the company settled on 50-50 joint ventures with Transocean. The year 2008, proved to be a good year for the company, with the partnership with Chevron. The partnership provided Pacific Drilling with the DGS(Dual Gradient Drilling) method, a high technology innovation that made deepwater drilling easy and profitable.DGD system gave the drillers a competitive advantage in the market, they were able to drill in places previously called “undrillable”, which in turn increased their productivity and market advantage.
The company CEO's vision was to make the Pacific Drilling a preferred, high specification,floating-rig contractor. The company firm environment was described as one of the best in the drilling market, the company focused mainly on customer satisfaction and worker safety. Focus on the safety of workers through “Stop Work Obligation” has increased the productivity of the organization. The company believed in creating cultural entrepreneurship and accountability.
The company stock saw a decline from $14 per share to $4 per share in the year 2014. The major factor in the decline of the share was due to a decrease in the company revenue by 5%. The decline was due to the fall in global oil prices from $138 per barrel to $49 per barrel. The decrease in the oil price hit the company's overall sales and profit. New emerging challenges were also adding up to the company views, new competitors with advanced drilling rigs were taking a strong position in the market due to which the company lost possible customers.

## Offshore drilling
Offshore drilling is the process of extracting petroleum products from beneath the seabed through wellbores. Offshore drilling facilities are very large and expensive, some offshore frilling facilities are up to 1120meter below the surface. They are mainly built in the oceans where the environment is harsh and challenging. 
Due to the ever-increasing population and innovation, the global demand for oil and gas has increased dramatically in the world. ¾ that of the earth is covered by the oceans, the lands beneath the oceans are the major source of petroleum products. Offshore drilling suitable drilling method for the discovery of the products beneath the oceans for fulfilling the demands of the population. The production of offshore oil and gas helps to increase the revenues to the government with the significant growth in the nation’s GDP, gives jobs to the large group of manpower and increases the employment rate, supports oil supply and service companies in the mainland(Allen, 2009).
Offshore drilling has been a great method for exploring the seabed for petroleum products, but it also comes with various challenges and difficulties. The major offshore drilling company faces is the extreme weather and unpredictable weather of the oceans. The transportation of oil products is also difficult. Environment protection has been a great challenge for the drilling companies, oil leakages, destruction of ocean ridges, and habitat of the sea life are some threats the drilling company poses. These challenges have led to various problems with environmental agencies and governments.
## Types of Offshore drilling
Exploratory wells have been drilled in up to 7.000 feet of water while shallow core holes have been drilled in the deepest ocean areas of the world. A total of 64,000 offshore wells have been drilled to date; 3,500 wells are now being drilled per year(Howe, 1986). Offshore drilling companies typically use three types of drilling rigs, Jackup rigs, semisubmersibles, and drillships. The majority of the market uses these three rigs for maximum production and efficiency. The use and advantages of the three offshore drillings are explained below
1. Jack-ups rigs:
Jack-up rigs are the typical floating rigs with 3 to 4 legs for support. The legs are penetrated on the seafloor, due to which the jack-up rigs have better support and safety. They are typically used for extracting petroleum products from the deep sea reservoir. These types of rigs were first invented in 1954 and even though the technology has been changing the premium jack-up rigs are still in use and they can drill up to 400 feet deep as well(Tanaka et al., 2005).The Jack-ups rigid shine in the challenging environments with high pressure which helps in the safety of the equipment and workers.
2. Semi-Submersibles Platforms:
Semi-submersibles rigs or MODU(Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit) is a partially submerged platform that is equipped with offshore drilling rigs, oil production platform, heavy lifting crane, and safety vessels. Semi-submersibles platforms are best used for stability of the platform, better safety, and storage of the oils. They can operate up to 3km in-depth and are well known for their safety.
3. Drillships Rigs:
Drillship rigs are mobile units that can move from one drilling location to another location on their own. Drilling rigs can operate up to 3km depth and are suitable for working in harsh and remote environments. They are technologically advanced, dynamic positioning systems are used to operate drillships. These rigs are the most demanded in recent times due to their mobility and operation.
## Fall of the stock price of Pacific drilling company
During the year 2014, the price of Pacific Drilling SA went from $11 per share to $4 per share, even though the company remained profitable throughout the year 2014. The major reason for the stock price fall for the pacific drilling company was its 3rd quarter result. The result was not going well as the company was losing money due to the global oil price crash. The debt level management side of the company was the major culprit as the company was in $2.9 billion in debt. The quarter result has shown a 5% revenue fall and a 13% net worth fall per share. During the year 2014, the global price of the oil came to a record low of $38 per barrel which led to offshore drillers like pacific drilling losing money.
## 2014: Global oil price movement and Pacific Drilling SA shares
Starting in mid-June 2014, petroleum prices began to fall worldwide, and that drop continued at a significantly accelerated rate through the end of January 2015. After peaking at $107.95 a barrel on June 20, 2014, petroleum prices plunged to $44.08 a barrel by January 28, 2015, a drop of 59.2 percent in a little over 7 months(Tokic, 2015)
Pacific drilling saw a decrease in its revenue due to the price fall of oil per barrel. Pacific drilling was forced to sell off to boost acceleration in the production.2014 global oil price movement can be seen as a major factor in the decrease of Pacific Drilling company share.
## Collaboration with Chevron
A business-level Cooperative strategy is used to combine firms by combining their resources for creating a competitive advantage in one or more product markets (Nielsen, 1988). Strategic alliances are carried out by industries, businesses to create a competitive advantage in the market, to create a monopoly to outperform the competitors. The strategic alliance gives companies a strong position in the market as those companies have more financial power and more brand equity.
In 2008, Integrated multinational cooperation, Chevron supported the rising Pacific Drilling company with the refining and marketing of the refined oil. Chevron helped the drilling company with technological innovation, DGD(Dual-Gradient Drilling) an innovation that makes oil company to explore vast reservoirs and extract them. In the year 2012 Pacific Drilling company signed a 5-year contract with Chevron for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The contract proved to be the best opportunity for the Pacific Driller. With the implementation of DGD, the Drilling company improved its operating and management system to better fit the new DGD system. The DGD system reduces the cost of drilling and increased the extraction of crude oil.
Chevron had a major influence on the culture and management of the Pacific Drilling. Pacific drilling was not open to other investments as new working culture would have caused problems in management and productivity. This problem was a drawback as it stopped the growth of the company. Chevron plates a significant role in the establishment of Pacific Drilling as a prominent and profitable company in the market. The collaboration move with Chevron proved to be the best and most profitable move for Pacific Drilling SA.
## Challenges
As a startup company in 2006, Pacific Drilling went through various ups and downs in the drilling industry. From the 2008 financial crisis to the 2014 oil bust the company went through various stages. The breakthrough Pacific Drilling got was during the 5-year contract with Chevron to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, the gold heaven for offshore drilling. Some major challenges are
### Technological Challenge:
The company was equipped with a DGD system, the most advanced system for drilling in the offshore environment. The competitors in the drilling industries were finding new solutions to tackle the threat, they were upgrading their ships with more new technologies for efficient works. New drillships were introduced to the market which was more mobile and easy to operate. The technology of the Pacific drilling was lacking new computer technologies.
### Market Challenges: Competition in the market and international oil price
Beginning in June 2014, the nominal Brent price of crude oil began a rapid decline, falling from $112 in June to $62 in December, a 6-month decline of 44%. The price continued to fall in 2015 and 2016, reaching a low of $31 in January 2016, a cumulative decrease of more than 70%(Prest, 2018). The drilling companies took a major hit on their revenue. Pacific drilling saw a decrease of more than 5% in their revenue. The global energy demand was record low, and it was not likely to go away soon. The offshore rigs increased from 670 to 950 from 2008 to 2015. The competition was high in the market, new technologies were introduced. The day rates were also increasing. There was less profit and more expense in the market.
