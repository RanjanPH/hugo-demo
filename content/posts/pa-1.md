# Competitive Advantages and Challenges at Starbucks
## Competitive Advantage of Starbucks
Competitive advantage refers to the factor that allows a company to produce goods or services better or more cheaply than its rivals. This factor allows the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins compared to its market rivals. (Competitive Advantage Definition, n.d.). Starbucks is a dominating multinational chain of coffee houses and roastery reserves. They are known as the largest coffee house chain in the world with stores 33830 in more than 80 countries. (Number of Starbucks Stores Worldwide 2019 | Statista, n.d.). Starbucks has maintained its competitive advantage in the market through the blend of technology and innovations. The use of the Starbucks app for pre-order, fast service, and mobile payment service has given them a head start in the competitive market. Generation of new recipes and ideas through crowdsourcing platform i.e My Starbucks Idea (Hossain & Islam, 2015). This also increases the interaction between the company and customers which has been a major competitive advantage of Starbucks in the market. Starbucks Introduction of “Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room”, a place where customers can see their coffee brewing, interact with the master brewer, which is targeted to the wealthy customers has been a major advantage as the targeted population is ready to pay the increased price for a coffee.

## Challenges
Starbuck being a multinational company with more than 33 thousand stores worldwide faces a lot of challenges. Its major competitors are Dunking donut, Mac coffee, etc. Starbucks has major competitive advantages over them but to maintain the challenge is a true hassle. The introduction of Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room has increased the value among the customers, but the costly price is a major challenge. The introduction of new recipes from the crowdsourcing platform has a positive impact on the values of customers but crowdsourcing has its own set of problems, some ideas get missed, need for more manpower to go through people's ideas is major challenge crowdsourcing. The increased price of the coffee beans has hit the price of Starbucks coffees due to which regular customers are choosing cheap alternatives. In a powerful market like China, India due to the expensive price of Starbucks coffee stores is closing down, which is a challenge Starbucks has to look into.

## Capabilities of Starbucks and Core competence
Business capabilities focus on the enterprise’s ability to perform activities from a functional perspective, for example, conduct ”customer management” or ”direct sales”.(“A METHOD FOR BUSINESS CAPABILITY DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS,” 2011). Starbucks a multinational chain of coffee houses and roastery is well known in the world for its premium coffee and ambient shops. Starbucks has various capabilities which mainly focuses on customers services and premium products, some of which are as follows
### Brand equity: 
Brand equity is the core strength of any brand and differentiation factor from its competitor. Starbuck focuses primarily on its customer and their satisfaction. Its customer-centric product and service make its brand equity strong.
### Product quality:
Starbuck is known for providing the best quality coffee along with snacks and a variety of drinks ranging from vegan options to caffeine-free drinks. Starbuck adopted a fair trade policy in the year 200 which has enabled them to bring the best quality coffee beans from farmers around the world. (Rizqiyanto, 2017)
### Customer service
Starbuck as mentioned above focuses primarily on customers. Its coffee house table is round in shape so people don’t feel lonely. The shop is built on Jazz them of the ’60s so people can forget the everchanging world outside. The fast service, variety of options has built a strong customer and organization relationship.
### Core competence
Core competencies are defined as “the basic knowledge, attitudes, skills, and observable behaviors that lead to excellence in the workplace.”(Liles & Mustian, 2004). The core competence of an organization can be categorized by the use of the VRIO framework. The VRIO framework is an internal analysis that helps businesses identify the advantages and resources that give them a competitive edge. (“VRIO Framework,” 2021)
From the VRIO model, Brand equity and customer service are the major core competence of Starbucks. Starbucks is a name everyone compares with wealth and respect. The customers of Starbucks are satisfied with the ambient air of stores, customer service, and best quality coffee products. Thus, Brand equity and customer service have helped Starbuck stand out among its competitor.
### The mission of Starbucks and Recommendation to reach the mission
Defined as an enduring statement of purpose that distinguishes one organization from other similar enterprises, a mission statement is a declaration of an organization’s ‘reason for being’. (David, 1989). Starbucks also has a well-defined mission statement, “To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.”  Starbuck is a multinational chain of coffee houses and roastery. It’s working hard and more smartly on achieving its mission, but it lacks on some points according to my view. Some of my recommendation to Starbucks are as follow,
## Recommendations
Due to the ever-increasing global scarcity of coffee beans in the world, the price of cups of coffee has risen in Starbuck coffee shops. Its mission one neighborhood at a time is well achieved by its ever-increasing chain, but Starbucks should keep in mind that not all neighborhoods are wealthy. So, a little decrease in the price would give normal customers a chance of love that Starbuck shares. 
## Strategic CEO and Recommendation
Strategic planning is a type of planning which is a step-by-step process with definite objectives and end products that can be implemented and evaluated. Very simply, it is a process by which we look into the future, paint a picture of that future based on current trends, and influence the forces that will affect us. (Bouhali et al., 2015). The present CEO of Starbuck is Kevin Johnson, appointed in 2015 who is the former CEO of Juniper Networks. He was appointed as CEO of Starbucks in 2015 and has done various improvements to Starbucks' global chain domination and digitalization.
I believe he is a Strategic leader from his work during the corona pandemic, during the pandemic, he launched the Starbuck App for pre-order and fast cashless transactions, which has more than 12million active users. His strategic thinking was seen during the Starbucks chain expansion in China, when expanding in the Chinese market Starbuck choose main streets with high person flow to increase its chance of capital consumption of coffee. He introduce Membership cards for Starbucks loyal customers, the cardholders were provided with discounts, special services, and many more which helped to increase customer loyalty.
So, his work during the crisis(corona pandemic) and expansion in China shows Kevin Johnson is a strategic leader.
## Recommendation 
Some major challenges (to understand)
He is facing challenges in the customer's loyalty, due to the ever-increasing price of coffee most middle-class people can’t afford Starbuck products. There are more cheap alternatives to Starbuck like Dunken Donuts, so he should consider lowering the price of coffee products.
Kevin Jhonson should think about expanding the Starbucks chain in the Indian Subcontinent as the population and economic growth is seen high in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. So, there is an opportunity for Starbucks to maintain global domination.
Starbucks has been established as a coffee chain house, but its menus are a mess with too many food items, noncaffeinated drinks, and others beverages. So, he should consider removing some food items from the menu to preserve Starbucks' identity as a Coffee house and roastery.
