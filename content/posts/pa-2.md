# CEO and complex job
CEOs are responsible for everything in the company, they have higher and fire responsibilities. Different CEOs choose different methods of managing the company some choose to manage by walking around different branches in the company and some CEOs to look at financial statements and manage the company on day to day basis. The ultimate role of CEOs is to make and manage strategy for the company, lead the top teams, and set a behavioral example among the employees. A CEO makes strategic designs like resource allocation, hiring of top-level executives, managing decisions on expanding to new ventures. These all are the strategic designs that CEOs of a company take on a regular basis. Their core job is to listen to different ideas and plans from executives and make the final decision. If a company wants to expand its venture then they go series of research and study to find out the possible ventures, but at the end of the day, it’s the CEO’s job to make the final decision whether or not to expand their venture.CEOs are the pillar of behavioral examples, employees look upon the CEOs as examples, so it’s the CEO’s job to set an example and develop a culture in the organization. A company compromise of different branches and heads. Each department has its own executive office. A CEO's job is to manage and give recommendations to top executives from different branches and departments
CEOs have control over everything that happens in the company, they have authority over the financial, marketing, and other days to day activities of a company. They are responsible for how the product does on the market, they are responsible for finding the best strategy to compete in the market.CEOs have to lower the expense and increase the profit. They have to deal with different departments to ensure every department is working towards the same objectives to improve the firm.
Tim Cook was appointed as the CEO of Apple inc in the year 2011. He was the succession CEO of Stev Job, the marketing genius who made Apple inc as one of the largest technical giants. Cook was not a marketing genius nor he was a strict and ruthless person as Job was, so many of the investors were in doubt that he won’t make Apple inc a great success in the growing tech world. People doubted his ability to handle the new production of apple phones, they were not sure he will increase the revenue of the company.



## Internal and external managerial labor markets
Internal labor markets are those where workers are hired into entry-level jobs and higher levels are filled from within. External labor markets imply that workers move somewhat fluidly between firms and wages are determined by some aggregate process where firms do not have significant discretion over wage-setting(Internal and external labor markets: a personnel economics approach). Tim Cook was appointed as CEO of Apple inc in the year 2011 through internal hiring, he was COO before succeeding  Stev Job. Ron Johnson was hired as CEO of JC penny as an external hiring process.
The internal hiring process is a much easier and fast process while replacing employees or filling the vacant position. Compared to the external hiring process, which is a time-consuming and hassle process, internal hiring makes it easier for the board to select someone capable of running the organization within the firm. Tim Cook joined Apple Inc in the year 1998 as an SVP of a worldwide operation. Before succeeding Stev Job as the CEO of the company in 2011 he worked as COO under Stev Job. Tim Cook has had worked for Apple for more than 13yrs in the company under Stev Job so he had knowledge of every in and outs of the company.
In my opinion, external hiring is a risky process, those hired from the external market are relatively unaware of companies' culture and work ethics. They will have a hard time being familiar with every top executive and work scenario of the company. External hiring can also have a negative impact on the existing employees' morale as they will not be happy to see some outsider as their leader or executive officer. If someone from outside was to succeed Jobs as the CEO of Apple inc, he would have faced a lot of problems in the leadership department as apple employees were used to Job’s dynamic and ruthless leadership style. Hiring Tim Cook from the internal labor market made the job easy for apple as Cook was loyal to apple and had a good experience in Apple's culture and ethics.
Tim Cook had already worked for Apple for more than 13 yrs as SVP and COO. He had experienced Job's work and ethics first hand and was responsible for the major success of Apple inc. Cook was responsible for deals on flash memory for storage systems in iPhones and ipad which lay the foundation of apple products. So, hiring Cook from the internal labor market to replace Job was a good decision.
