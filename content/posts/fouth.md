# Case Summary: Alphabitic inc: Reorganizing google

## Executive summary:
In 2015, Alphabet created two different business segments that provide more accountability and transparency. The beginning of the AI-powered era, the rescription of google, and the expansion of the company with its competitive advantage in the ever more changing world are examined in this paper.

## The Beginning
a.  Google
Google was founded in the year 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Google is the largest search engine in the world. The company started with the mission to “Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” and in those spirits, Google has been growing and as for 2015, its revenues was $74.5 billion where over 90% of the earnings came from a strong online advertising business model. (Hitt, Ireland)
 
Google has made impactful changes in the web market. They have launched several web-based services like the one in which we write our projects, Google DOCS.Google founders Page and Brin, both are strategic leaders, who made the internet a revolution. Over the year due to the strategic activities of the founders, Google has gained a competitive advantage on the internet through its eco-system, google email, google photos, google AI  for machine  learning, etc. They are making the internet an easy place for people to learn, share and live. Google has introduced the Google X division, where the most talented, visionary people work and share to make google a better palace on the internet. The  Google X division develops extraordinary technologies like Self-driving cars, AI-powered machines and carries out different research on the field of AI and machine learning.

## Event of 2015- Alphabet Inc.
In October 2015, Google rename and created itself as Alphabet, a totally new holding company that is more focused on diverse business markets and scenarios rather than web based search. The creation of Alphabet inc opened the door for many business ideas. The name Google was limiting them on web-based search only, but Alphabet opened new ventures and possibilities on the internet. Alphabet creation was for making it a holding company in which all business the founders has developed and created were separated into two segments: 
Google - Google represented all the internet-based operations of the company like data mining, web ecosystem for business like google docs, google spreadsheet, mobile operating system, google chrome, Youtube, etc. The google department looked on the internet as a core business. Search optimization was its core business.
Other Beta - The other beta side looked more on the scientific and AI breakthroughs of Alphabet inc.Self-driving cars, high-speed internet service throughout the world.The drone-based service of Alphabet inc was introduced in recent years. The other beta department was more focused on improving the lives of humans through scientific innovation in the AI and machine learning fields.

In  2015, Alphabet replace Google as the publicly-traded entity. This means that the share people and companies hold in the name of Google were turned into Alphabet inc. The restructuring of Google quickly demonstrated to have been beneficial for the company’s market valuation as the Class A shares (GOOGL), the ones with voting rights, increased 6% and added over $28 billion (Hitt, Ireland & Hoskisson, 2019, p. C-20).

The date of stock price below from Macrotrends LLC(2022), display Alphabet Stock from the year 2004 to 2020,  and another figure show the data from 2014- 2021. The table on the report shows Alphabet's historical annual stock price data which is great for reference on the valuation of stock price.

The ‘Year Close’ column shows that from 2010 - 2015 the stock price of Alphabet inc had increased by $185 and from 2015-2021 the stock price has raised from $771.820 to $ 2893.59.The growth has been more than doubled throughout the year, which shows that the company has a positive impact on the market and investors. 
As of Feb 2022, Alphabet’s stock price is at $ 2608.

## Effect of Google’s reconstruction decision:
The reconstruction of the company to two different business segments, Google and Other Beta was a strategic decision, which gave Google a competitive advantage. Microsofts and Apple were also getting hold of the search engine world during 2015, so google move to create Alphabet inc and diverse the company into two segments was a great strategic move.  The data from stock price also shows the increment in the price of Alphabet inc share every year. The segmentation has a great positive impact on shareholders. The reconstruction process made google more transparent, financially strong. Shareholders could see how the company was expanding in the AI business, which increase the trust of shareholders. AI and machine learning was a hot topic and google took a great competitive advantage on the market through investment in AI and scientific machine learning research.

The reconstruction process shows the increment of share price by 5% in the year 2015 and after the 2015 wave, the stock price of Alphabet is ever increasing. So we can conclude that Google’s reconstruction decision was best for the company.

## The expansion of Google Inc. into non-core businesses
In the year 2015, Google rename the company to Alphabet, in which it was divided into two segments, Google and Another beta . Other beta handled the non-core business of the company. The non-business segment includes self-driving cars, drones, etc. The picture below from Price & Nudelman (2016) on the news website ‘Business Insider’, clearly displays how businesses were separated under Alphabet.

The core business of Google was data and search engines. The separation made google easy to focus more on another side of business like AI and machines. They were able to improve their brand equity through research and machine learning. The division into two-segment made google work easy and fast. One segment was able to focus more on the internet and another segment the Other Beta was able to improve the business game and competitive advantage of the company. The diversification provided the company to explore the potential market and market risk, through which competitive advantage was made strong.

Reconstruction on Company’s Competitiveness, Profitability, and Valuation

Reconstruction has helped the company on its competitiveness, profitability, and valuation.Alphabet has soon improved every year from 2015 when reconstruction took place. The stock price has increased by double, from $700 to $2180 in the year 2021.
